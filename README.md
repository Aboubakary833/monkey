# Monkey programming language

## Introduction

**Monkey** is a little programming language designed by Thorsten Ball for his book `Writing an interpreter in Go`.
This repository contains my implementation of the language with new little features I take into account(like supporting <i>float number</i> <i>constants</i>, all prefix & infix operations on boolean).

## Main features of the language

Following are the features the language support:

- C-like syntax
- Varaiable bindings
- Constants
- Number & Booleans
- Strings
- Arrays
- Object(Hash data structure)
- Arithmetic expression
- Built-in functions
- First-class and higher-order function
- Closure

Following are the features I will probably implements later:

- Loops(`for`, `while`)
- Classes
- Comments
